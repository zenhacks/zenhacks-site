  Zenhacks Lab innovates the way people live by the power of technology, design and entrepernership. We are an international group of hackers, designers and [growth hackers ](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/02/defining-a-growth-hacker-three-common-characteristics/) who are dedicated to solving real problems. We've founded [several](http://manzuoapp.com) [startups](http://hua.li) and will continue doing so.

## Programs We Offer

### Zenintern
  Zenintern is an internship program designed for journeyman. With the practice of real-world projects, they could speed up the process to be a black band coder. We offer:
  
  - Full access to code repositories, direct contribution to running application.
  - Full access to internal resources and materials.
  - Competitive compensation, 150 RMB / day.

  Application will be open in 2 weeks. You could register for notification [here][pre-apply-form].

### ZenJobs
  ZenJobs are open for hackers, designers and growth hackers.

  We do not have different levels of programmers at zenhacks. We stay small and effective by having developers of the highest quality working together, able to communicate well and work closely.

  Programmers are first-class in the lab, they will be responsible for the design and development of new products. As a developer you will participate in prototyping and wireframing of projects, and be responsible for the user experience and usability of the applications we build.

  We choose our tools wisely but not obsessed with them. We believe that every developer should choose the tools that work best for them.  We build our [tech-stack][tech-stack-article] to help developers focus on their work and we encourage our developers to contribute to that.

  We took Friday afternoon to invest in ourselves. We would run hackthon, workshop or send Pull Request to open source projects.

  Application will be open in 2 weeks. You could subscribe our news [right now][pre-apply-form].

### Zenprentice
  Zenprentice is a program designed to help anyone who is interested in programming to start it in the right way. The old school way of teaching programming is not successful and we believe [most of The best programmers are self-taught](http://www.timesunion.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Square-CEO-Jack-Dorsey-Most-Of-The-Best-4321871.php). So in Zenprentice we will provide resource, trailmap and suggestion to help beginner to start.
