    <h4>Our Expectations</h4>
    <p>
    Here, we won't imprison you in some fixed position like those big companies usually do. We believe a hacker, as someone who wants to leverage technology/knowledge to make changes happen, he/she will eventually get a hand on all this stuff. That's what we expect who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
    But we do need some "roles" where you could start to work with us. You could apply either one of them or multiple.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here is some principles we will use to find "you":
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Fundamentals</b> is more important than know-how.</li>
      <li> <b>Learning ability and attitude</b> is more important than expertise. </li>
      <li> <b>What you will do</b> is more important than what you have done.</li>
      <li> <b>Access to solutions</b> is more important than solutions.</li>
      <li> <b>Action</b> is more important than idea and word.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>

    <% data.roles.each do |role| %>
      <h4 class="acc-trigger">
        <a href="#"><%= role['name'] %></a>
      </h4>

      <div class="acc-container">
        <div class="content">
          <% role['requirements'].each do |line| %>
            <li><%= line %></li>
          <% end %>
        </div>
      </div>
    <% end %>
