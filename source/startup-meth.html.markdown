## Principles

- Specify value from the standpoint of the end customer by product family.
- Identify all the steps in the value stream for each product family, eliminating whenever possible those steps that do not create value.
- Make the value-creating steps occur in tight sequence so the product will flow smoothly toward the customer.
- As flow is introduced, let customers pull value from the next upstream activity.
- As value is specified, value streams are identified, wasted steps are removed, and flow and pull are introduced, begin the process again and continue it until a state of perfection is reached in which perfect value is created with no waste.

## Action Plan

###Getting Started

- **Find a change agent**, a leader who will take personal responsibility for the lean transformation.
- **Get the lean knowledge**, via a sensei or consultant, who can teach lean techniques and how to implement them as part of a system, not as isolated programs.
- Find a lever by **seizing a crisis** or by creating one to begin the transformation. If your company currently isn't in crisis, focus attention on a lean competitor or find a lean customer or supplier who will make demands for dramatically better performance.
- **Forget grand strategy** for the moment.
- **Map the value streams**, beginning with the current state of how material and information flow now, then drawing a leaner future state of how they should flow and creating an implementation plan with timetable.
- **Begin as soon as possible** with an important and visible activity.
Demand immediate results.
- **As soon as you've got momentum, expand your scope** to link improvements in the value streams and move beyond the shop floor to office processes.

###Creating an Organization to Channel Your Value Streams
- Reorganize your firm by product family and value stream.
- Create a lean promotion function.
- Deal with excess people at the outset, and then promise that no one will lose their job in the future due to the introduction of lean techniques.
- Devise a growth strategy.
- Remove the anchor-draggers.
- Once you've fixed something, fix it again.
- "Two steps forward and one step backward is O.K.; no steps forward is not O.K."

###Install Business Systems to Encourage Lean Thinking
- Utilize policy deployment.
Create a lean accounting system.
- Pay your people in relation to the performance of your firm.
- Make performance measures transparent.
- Teach lean thinking and skills to everyone.
- Right-size your tools, such as production equipment and information systems.

###Completing the Transformation
- Convince your suppliers and customers to take the steps just described.
- Develop a lean global strategy.
- Convert from top-down leadership to leadership based on questioning, coaching, and teaching and rooted in the scientific method of plan-do-check-act
